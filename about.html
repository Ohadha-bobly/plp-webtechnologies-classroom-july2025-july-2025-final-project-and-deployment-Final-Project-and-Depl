        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            AccessAble Solutions was founded in 2020 when Geoffrey Ohadha, after
            years of working as a UX designer, realized how many digital
            products were inadvertently excluding users with disabilities. What
            started as a passion project to help local businesses make their
            websites more accessible has grown into a comprehensive
            accessibility consulting firm serving clients across industries and
            around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we're proud to have helped over 200 organizations improve
            their digital accessibility, trained thousands of professionals in
            inclusive design practices, and contributed to making the web a more
            accessible place for everyone. Our work has directly impacted
            millions of users, ensuring they can access information, services,
            and opportunities online with dignity and independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're not just consultants, we're advocates, educators, and partners
            in the journey toward digital inclusion. Every project we take on is
            an opportunity to create positive change and move closer to our
            vision of a truly accessible digital world.
